# Professional-Portfolio
Hello, and thank you for visiting my portfolio! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m Troy Hawkins, a passionate and driven web developer who recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp. This portfolio showcases the projects Iâ€™ve worked on during my learning journey, along with the skills Iâ€™ve developed in web development. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of my best work, including deployed web applications, all built with a focus on clean design, responsive layouts, and user-friendly interfaces.


## Description
This is my personal developer portfolio showcasing my skills, projects, and work experience. It's designed to give potential employers a clear view of my previous work and the technologies I've used. The portfolio includes a responsive layout with navigation that scrolls to the relevant sections, including my projects, personal information, and contact details.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
